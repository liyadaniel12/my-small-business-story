        <p>I have always dreamed of becoming a businesswoman. When I was in grade eleven, I opened my very first online shop on Instagram, sharing products and connecting with customers in a way that felt exciting and full of possibility. Later on, I expanded my efforts to include a Telegram channel so I could reach even more people and create a stronger community around my small business. The idea for this venture first came to me during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, a time when everything felt uncertain, overwhelming, and out of balance. I wanted to find a way to stay productive and focused instead of feeling stuck. After I returned to school, I started by sourcing and selling second-hand clothes, which allowed me to build experience step by step. Over time, I slowly grew more confident year by year, learning how to present my products, communicate with customers, and trust my own abilities as an entrepreneur.</p>

    <p>When my freshman year ended, my city, Bahir Dar, was under a state of emergency and there was no internet connection for several months. Because of this, I had to pause my business temporarily. During that time, I didn‚Äôt want to sit still, so I started going to big hotels to use their WiFi whenever I could. I took online courses in digital marketing from Awaki to improve my skills and enrolled in a management degree at a private college called Alkan.</p>
    <p>After that period ended and life slowly returned to normal, I joined the Information Systems department at Bahir Dar Institute of Technology to deepen my understanding of technology and business. Since then, I have continued running my online shop, expanding to platforms like Jiji and adding Facebook and Instagram promotions alongside my Telegram channel. Today, I am working hard to grow my business further, and I feel more confident and capable than ever. I believe this is just the beginning, and soon, I will add even more products and ideas to make my dream a reality.</p>
